## Introduction

Neural networks are a fundamental building block in the field of deep learning. This repository provides a comprehensive introduction to the basic concepts, architecture, and training methods of neural networks. By the end of this module, you will have a solid understanding of how neural networks work and how they are trained.

## Neural Network Architecture

### Layers

A neural network is composed of multiple layers that process input data to generate an output. These layers include:

- **Input Layer**: The layer that receives the initial data.
- **Hidden Layers**: Intermediate layers where the actual computation and pattern recognition happen.
- **Output Layer**: The final layer that provides the output of the neural network.

### Neurons

Neurons are the fundamental units of a neural network. Each neuron receives input, processes it using a specific function, and passes the output to the next layer. The collective behavior of neurons in a layer determines the output of that layer.

### Activation Functions

Activation functions introduce non-linearity into the network, enabling it to learn complex patterns. Common activation functions include:

- **Sigmoid**: Maps input values to a range between 0 and 1.
- **ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit)**: Outputs the input directly if positive; otherwise, it outputs zero.
- **Tanh**: Maps input values to a range between -1 and 1.

## Training Neural Networks

### Backpropagation

Backpropagation is the process used to update the weights of the network in the reverse direction of the gradient of the loss function. It calculates the gradient of the loss function with respect to each weight by the chain rule, iteratively updating the weights to minimize the loss.

### Gradient Descent

Gradient Descent is an optimization algorithm used to minimize the loss function. By calculating the gradient of the loss function, the algorithm adjusts the weights iteratively to find the minimum loss.

### Loss Functions

The loss function measures the difference between the predicted output and the actual output. Common loss functions include:

- **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**: Measures the average squared difference between the predicted and actual values.
- **Cross-Entropy Loss**: Used for classification tasks, measuring the difference between the predicted probability distribution and the actual distribution.
